## Home Office
* Designate a room as office. This helps keeping home and work seperated.
* Let your colleagues know when you are online, and make sure to be avaiable via a chat program or email.
* Keep a routine. Start at the same time, have a lunch break and stop at the end of the day. 
* Maintain regular hours.
* Don't forget to log your time if you have to.

## Conference Calling
* Assume every meeting is a remote meeting.
* Send meeting details well ahead of time.
* Try to avoid calling in as a group under one account, groups are harder to hear and talk amongst themselves
* Speak English at all times if there is more than one language.
* Invest in proper audio
    - When hosting a group; teleconference microphones like Jabra Speak.
    - For callers sitting alone; use a proper headphone with mic
    - Mute when not speaking
* Use a tool such as zoom.us, whereby, jit.si or hangouts
    - That has a web version that requires no installation.
    - If possible has dial-in.
    - Recording option.
* No offline tools are used, everything is online. 
    - Stickies & Whiteboard? Use Miro.com / awwapp.com
    - Notes? Share a Google Doc.
* Appoint a note-taker and post notes for others to read afterwards.
* For more than 2 callers; appoint a moderator that involves people dialling in by asking them to speak and checks chat/slack channels if someone is mentioning a connection issue.
* Stable internet connections are important
    - Make sure everyone has at least 1.5Mbps up AND down, test with fast.com.
    - Slow connection? Dial in.
    - Disable video when possible, have one person share their screen.
* Always send a summary with actions to take via mail as a followup

## (Mental) Health
* As mentioned before; stick to a routine. This is one of the most important advices.
* When possible, go for a daily walk or jog to get some fresh air
* Take breaks away from the work station so once in a while
* With a full kitchen and pantry just steps away its tempting to snack a lot, go for healthy opions 
* Socialise with colleagues. Try to set up regular catchups to talk off-topic with your colleagues or attend online meetups.
* Take sick days when you're ill.
