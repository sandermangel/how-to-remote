# How To Remote
A collection of practical tips for working from home. All contributions are welcome, learn more on how to do so [here](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request).

## Home Office
* Designate a room as office. This helps keeping home and work seperated.
* Keep a routine. Start at the same time, have a lunch break and stop at the end of the day. 
* Let your colleagues know when you are online, and make sure to be avaiable via a chat program or email.

## Conference Calling
* Assume every meeting is a remote meeting.
* Send meeting details well ahead of time.
* Try to avoid calling in as a group under one account, groups are harder to hear and talk amongst themselves
* Speak English at all times if there is more than one language.
* Invest in proper audio
    - When hosting a group; teleconference microphones like Jabra Speak.
    - For callers sitting alone; use a proper headphone with mic
    - Mute when not speaking
* Use a tool such as zoom.us, appear.in or hangouts
    - That has a web version that requires no installation.
    - If possible has dial-in.
    - Recording option.
* No offline tools are used, everything is online. 
    - Stickies & Whiteboard? Use Miro.com / awwapp.com
    - Notes? Share a Google Doc.
* Appoint a note-taker and post notes for others to read afterwards.
* For more than 2 callers; appoint a moderator that involves people dialling in by asking them to speak and checks chat/slack channels if someone is mentioning a connection issue.
* Stable internet connections are important
    - Make sure everyone has at least 1.5Mbps up AND down, test with fast.com.
    - Slow connection? Dial in.
    - Disable video when possible, have one person share their screen.
* Always send a summary with actions to take via mail as a followup
